name: OpenAPI prepare for Prism proxy validation
# Prism: https://github.com/stoplightio/prism
# Prism, used as a validating proxy, doesn't like advanced nested structures with all-of and $ref.
#
# We therefore do some transformations whenever the OpenAPI contract is updated
# - generate_paths.py: Creates file openapi-contract/generated/api-contract-with-full-path.yaml where endpoint paths include the /{{API_NAME}} used by API Management
# - openapi-flattener: https://github.com/equinor/openapi-flattener This package takes an OpenApi (yaml | json) file and flattens all references in the file.
