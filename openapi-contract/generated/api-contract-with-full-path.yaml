  description: "The Timewriting API is an open API covering the HR area.\nIt's an\
    \ example API used to demonstrate the [api-first-workbench](https://github.com/equinor/api-first-workbench)\
    \ and has not been implemented.\n\nThis document describes release v1.0.1. We\
    \ recommend using documentation published at https://equinor.github.io/api-first-workbench\
    \ as it provides the best developer experience.\nInformation on the next release\
    \ v1.1.0 is available at [this page](https://equinor.github.io/api-first-workbench/latest/)\n\
    \n# Introduction\nThe API is designed and built according to [Equinor's API strategy](https://github.com/equinor/api-strategy).\n\
    \nThe API is documented in OpenAPI 3.0 format and follows REST principles.\n\n\
    ## Terminology\nThe API will use common terminology used across the Oil&Gas industry.\n\
    \n## API versioning\n`api-version` must be present in all request as part of the\
    \ query string. **Requests without API version will be rejected with a HTTP 404\
    \ response code**. The latest api-version is v1.\n\nThe `api-version` will stay\
    \ stable over time as the API follows the principles of [API evolution](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/api-evolution-for-rest-http-apis)\n\
    \n## Subscription key\nSubscription key must be created from [Equinor's API Portal](https://api.equinor.com/products/corporate)\
    \ for the consumer application  and each request must have the HTTP header `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`\
    \ present with this value.\n\n## Authentication and authorization overview\nThe\
    \ user executing the API requests will need to authenticate with OAuth 2.0 authorization\
    \ code flow with Equinor Azure AD as the identity provider. \n\n# Modelling of\
    \ resources\n## Resources\nThe resource will be named according to common terminology\
    \ used across the Oil&Gas industry (for example Norsok standard NS-EN 13306 and\
    \ ISO 14224).\n\nExample of resources are `/time-entries` and `/cost-objects`.\n\
    \n## Resource keys\nResources keys will indicate the resource type as part of\
    \ the name. \nExample: `timeEntryId` and `costObjectId`.\n\n## Dates\nAll date\
    \ and time information are based on UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) and formatted\
    \ according to [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt)\n\nThis also applies\
    \ to durations, such as 1 day or 2 hours, which are encoded as `P0Y0M1DT0H0M0S`\
    \ and `P0Y0M0DT2H0M0S`.\n\nThese values are easily compatible with time libraries\
    \ such as [moment.js library](https://momentjs.com/docs/).\n\n# Modelling of endpoints\n\
    ## Operation - Lookup\nLookup operations return a single instance for the resource\
    \ based on the key.\n\nThe resource may have related data which may or may not\
    \ be relevant for a client. In order to indicate which related data to include,\
    \ the lookup operation may provide `include-...` query string boolean options.\n\
    Example: `include-time-entries`\n\n## Operation - Search/Filter\nClients need\
    \ to retrieve a subset of all resources for an endpoint. Usually, the criteria\
    \ are non-trivial and in many case are not direct properties of the resource.\
    \ REST does not provide a well-defined pattern for these types of requests. \n\
    \nOur approach, is to provide predefined filters with parameters. Each filter\
    \ is documented in the OpenAPI specification.\n\n## Operation - Update\nUpdate\
    \ operations for resources will utilize a sub-set of the JSON Patch proposed standard.\
    \ JSON Patch is described in [RFC 6902](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) with\
    \ a user-friendly version at [http://jsonpatch.com/](http://jsonpatch.com/). \n\
    \nOur goals with using JSON Patch is to focus on the intent of the update and\
    \ avoid common pitfalls for the client. The common pitfalls we avoid with JSON\
    \ Patch are: \n1. Clients inadvertently resetting properties of a resource to\
    \ an empty value. This due to the client mistakenly sending all properties of\
    \ a resource in a HTTP PATCH request with some of them having an initial value.\n\
    1. Clients inadvertently overwriting changes made by other users directly in the\
    \ back-end system. This due to client mistakenly have provided properties which\
    \ have not been changed in a HTTP PATCH request.\n\nUsing JSON Patch is straightforward.\
    \ \n- Set the content-type to `application/json-patch+json`. \n- In the body,\
    \ send an array of JSON Patch operations. Typically, one element pr property to\
    \ be update for the resource\n\nAs part of the OpenAPI documentation, we will\
    \ provide concrete examples for all update operation. In addition, the schema\
    \ definiton for the request body defines which resource properties can be updated.\n\
    \nExample of JSON Patch request body which replaces the value of the properties\
    \ title and text:\n```\n[\n  {\n    \"op\": \"replace\",\n    \"path\": \"/comment\
    \ \",\n    \"value\": \"New comment\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"op\": \"replace\",\n \
    \   \"path\": \"/hours\",\n    \"value\": 4\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## HTTP Response codes\n\
    HTTP response codes will follow established best practice for REST services and\
    \ will be documented in the OpenAPI specification. \n\nBelow is a list of status\
    \ codes used in the API which the client should handle. \nCommon: \n* 400 Bad\
    \ Request - The request is invalid. For example missing parameters in the query\
    \ string\n* 401 Unauthorized - The request did not include an authentication token\
    \ or the authentication token was expired or invalid\n* 403 Forbidden - User does\
    \ not have sufficient permissions\n* 405 Method not allowed - HTTP verb not supported\
    \ for requested resource\n* 500 Internal Server Error - Sorry, an unexpected error\
    \ occured on our side. Let's us know and we'll get around to fix it\n* 503 Service\
    \ unavailable - API or a service it depends on is currently not available. \n\n\
    Read - HTTP GET:\n* 200 OK - The request completed successfully\n* 404 Not Found\
    \ - The resource does not exist or an non-existing endpoint has been called\n\n\
    Create - HTTP POST: \n* 201 Created - Create of resource was successful and resource\
    \ is returned in body\n* 400 Bad Request - The resource provided in the body is\
    \ not according to specification\n* 409 Conflict - The creation of this resource\
    \ is in conflict with an already existing resources\n\nCreate - HTTP PUT:\n* 204\
    \ No Content - Request successful but no resource returned in body\n\nUpdate -\
    \ HTTP PATCH: \n* 200 OK - Update of resource was successful and resource is returned\
    \ in body\n* 400 Bad Request - The resource properties to update is not according\
    \ to specification\n* 409 Conflict - The update of this resource is in conflict\
    \ with an already existing resources\n\nDelete - HTTP DELETE: \n* 204 No Content\
    \ - Request successful but no resource returned in body\n* 409 Conflict - The\
    \ deletion of this resource is not possible\n\n# Deprecation\n## Deprecation policy\n\
    The API will use the principles of [API evolution](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/api-evolution-for-rest-http-apis)\
    \ instead of introducing a new api-version on every breaking change.\n\nIn order\
    \ to achieve this, endpoints, query parameters and resource properties can become\
    \ deprecated and will be marked so in the OpenAPI specification.\n\nIn general,\
    \ depcrated properties will be removed after 3 months.\nIf a client uses a deprecated\
    \ endpoint or query parameter, the API will in the response provide a Sunset HTTP\
    \ header\n`Sunset: Sat, 15 May 2021 12:59:59 GMT` representing the removal date\
    \ for the deprecated feature as specified in [RFC8594](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8594).\
    \ In addition, a HTTP header `Link: <https://equinor.github.io/maintenance-api-docs/#section/Deprecation>;\
    \ rel=\"sunset\"` will be provided to pointing to relevant documentation.\n\n\
    Clients must monitor these messages and take corrective actions.\n\n## Endpoints\
    \ with deprecation\nNone\n\n# Feature requests\nFeature requests are welcomed\
    \ and can be submitted through: \n"
