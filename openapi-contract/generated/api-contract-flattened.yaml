    The API is documented in OpenAPI 3.0 format and follows REST principles.

    The API will use common terminology used across the Oil&Gas industry.


    ## API versioning

    `api-version` must be present in all request as part of the query string.
    **Requests without API version will be rejected with a HTTP 404 response
    code**. The latest api-version is v1.


    The `api-version` will stay stable over time as the API follows the
    principles of [API
    evolution](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/api-evolution-for-rest-http-apis)


    ## Subscription key

    Subscription key must be created from [Equinor's API
    Portal](https://api.equinor.com/products/corporate) for the consumer
    application  and each request must have the HTTP header
    `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` present with this value.


    ## Authentication and authorization overview

    The user executing the API requests will need to authenticate with OAuth 2.0
    authorization code flow with Equinor Azure AD as the identity provider. 


    # Modelling of resources

    ## Resources

    The resource will be named according to common terminology used across the
    Oil&Gas industry (for example Norsok standard NS-EN 13306 and ISO 14224).


    Example of resources are `/time-entries` and `/cost-objects`.


    ## Resource keys

    Resources keys will indicate the resource type as part of the name. 

    Example: `timeEntryId` and `costObjectId`.


    ## Dates

    All date and time information are based on UTC (Universal Time Coordinated)
    and formatted according to [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt)


    This also applies to durations, such as 1 day or 2 hours, which are encoded
    as `P0Y0M1DT0H0M0S` and `P0Y0M0DT2H0M0S`.


    These values are easily compatible with time libraries such as [moment.js
    library](https://momentjs.com/docs/).


    # Modelling of endpoints

    ## Operation - Lookup

    Lookup operations return a single instance for the resource based on the
    key.


    The resource may have related data which may or may not be relevant for a
    client. In order to indicate which related data to include, the lookup
    operation may provide `include-...` query string boolean options.

    Example: `include-time-entries`


    ## Operation - Search/Filter

    Clients need to retrieve a subset of all resources for an endpoint. Usually,
    the criteria are non-trivial and in many case are not direct properties of
    the resource. REST does not provide a well-defined pattern for these types
    of requests. 


    Our approach, is to provide predefined filters with parameters. Each filter
    is documented in the OpenAPI specification.


    ## Operation - Update

    Update operations for resources will utilize a sub-set of the JSON Patch
    proposed standard. JSON Patch is described in [RFC
    6902](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) with a user-friendly version at
    [http://jsonpatch.com/](http://jsonpatch.com/). 


    Our goals with using JSON Patch is to focus on the intent of the update and
    avoid common pitfalls for the client. The common pitfalls we avoid with JSON
    Patch are: 

    1. Clients inadvertently resetting properties of a resource to an empty
    value. This due to the client mistakenly sending all properties of a
    resource in a HTTP PATCH request with some of them having an initial value.

    1. Clients inadvertently overwriting changes made by other users directly in
    the back-end system. This due to client mistakenly have provided properties
    which have not been changed in a HTTP PATCH request.


    Using JSON Patch is straightforward. 

    - Set the content-type to `application/json-patch+json`. 

    - In the body, send an array of JSON Patch operations. Typically, one
    element pr property to be update for the resource


    As part of the OpenAPI documentation, we will provide concrete examples for
    all update operation. In addition, the schema definiton for the request body
    defines which resource properties can be updated.


    Example of JSON Patch request body which replaces the value of the
    properties title and text:

    ```

    [
      {
        "op": "replace",
        "path": "/comment ",
        "value": "New comment"
      },
      {
        "op": "replace",
        "path": "/hours",
        "value": 4
      }
    ]

    ```


    ## HTTP Response codes

    HTTP response codes will follow established best practice for REST services
    and will be documented in the OpenAPI specification. 


    Below is a list of status codes used in the API which the client should
    handle. 

    Common: 

    * 400 Bad Request - The request is invalid. For example missing parameters
    in the query string

    * 401 Unauthorized - The request did not include an authentication token or
    the authentication token was expired or invalid

    * 403 Forbidden - User does not have sufficient permissions

    * 405 Method not allowed - HTTP verb not supported for requested resource

    * 500 Internal Server Error - Sorry, an unexpected error occured on our
    side. Let's us know and we'll get around to fix it

    * 503 Service unavailable - API or a service it depends on is currently not
    available. 


    Read - HTTP GET:

    * 200 OK - The request completed successfully

    * 404 Not Found - The resource does not exist or an non-existing endpoint
    has been called


    Create - HTTP POST: 

    * 201 Created - Create of resource was successful and resource is returned
    in body

    * 400 Bad Request - The resource provided in the body is not according to
    specification

    * 409 Conflict - The creation of this resource is in conflict with an
    already existing resources


    Create - HTTP PUT:

    * 204 No Content - Request successful but no resource returned in body


    Update - HTTP PATCH: 

    * 200 OK - Update of resource was successful and resource is returned in
    body

    * 400 Bad Request - The resource properties to update is not according to
    specification

    * 409 Conflict - The update of this resource is in conflict with an already
    existing resources


    Delete - HTTP DELETE: 

    * 204 No Content - Request successful but no resource returned in body

    * 409 Conflict - The deletion of this resource is not possible


    # Deprecation

    ## Deprecation policy

    The API will use the principles of [API
    evolution](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/api-evolution-for-rest-http-apis)
    instead of introducing a new api-version on every breaking change.


    In order to achieve this, endpoints, query parameters and resource
    properties can become deprecated and will be marked so in the OpenAPI
    specification.


    In general, depcrated properties will be removed after 3 months.

    If a client uses a deprecated endpoint or query parameter, the API will in
    the response provide a Sunset HTTP header

    `Sunset: Sat, 15 May 2021 12:59:59 GMT` representing the removal date for
    the deprecated feature as specified in
    [RFC8594](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8594). In addition, a HTTP header
    `Link:
    <https://equinor.github.io/maintenance-api-docs/#section/Deprecation>;
    rel="sunset"` will be provided to pointing to relevant documentation.


    Clients must monitor these messages and take corrective actions.


    ## Endpoints with deprecation

    None

        ### Overview

        Perform time writing by supplying all time entries for a given calendar
        period.

        It's also possible to change individual time entries via endpoints `POST
        /time-entries`,`PATCH /time-entries/{time-entry-id}` and `DELETE
        /time-entries/{time-entry-id}`.

        ### Important information

        This operation overwrites all existing time writing in the given
        calendar period.

        If there are errors for one or more of the time entries, none of them
        will be updated.

        ### Overview

        Create single time entry for logged on user. 


        Clients should expect end users to have prexisting knowledge of the cost
        object to use for a time entry, but can assist them by providing
        suggestions based on earlier time entries from endpoint
        `/calendar/{start-date}/{end-date}`. A general search for cost objects
        used in the company will not be provided as it increases the risk for
        wrong time writing.


        The time entry will need approval by the task owner of the cost object
        after registration. It's recommended to provide a comment where possible
        in order ease the approval process. If the approver does not have enough
        information, the time entry will be sent back to the end user through
        the workflow inbox of the ERP system.


        The client is recommended to verify that the cost object exist and is
        open for time writing through the endpoint
        `/cost-objects/{cost-object-id}`.


        ### Important information

        The endpoint does not currently support clock times. If logged on user
        is configured for clock times, the request will fail with a `409 -
        Conflict` error.


        The request will fail with a `409 - Conflict` error if the date is more
        than 3 months in the past.
